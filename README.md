# SpaceTimeMemory
my personal space time memory 

i open the app and see a map https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map With open street map
I can click on plus to add a new diary entry
It takes my gps location, time and i can add a note
It gets displayed on the map
I can filer for time lines like 2003 or month or weeks and days and the map gets updated with the pins
Its 100% offline
With realm database encrypted Locally
I can export the database file
And https://realm.io/realm-flutter/

Would be cool if we can make a github project again open source where you outline the task and whenever you finished a task you write the hours and i pay you so its transparent to see for everyone how much everyone contributed
And the process of the app development is as transparent as possible
Documentation is super important
For people who want to build their own version And add apps and extensions To the mylife+ app
